# Introduction

Shortcut is a command-line tool designed to simplify the creation of global keyboard shortcuts across various platforms. By defining keyboard shortcuts in a straightforward JSON file, users can effortlessly assign commands to specific key combinations, like `Ctrl+C`, linking them to versatile shell commands that can execute tasks ranging from opening files to launching URLs. With the added benefit of `JSON` schema-based auto-completion, Shortcut streamlines the process of customizing keyboard functionalities to enhance user efficiency.
